# Blood Donor Registration Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is designed to analyze blood donor registration data for a specific group of individuals. It demonstrates how I used Python and pandas to organize, clean, and analyze large datasets for a real-world scenario. The focus of the analysis was to track registration details, categorize donors, and identify missing information across multiple CSV files.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project was to solve a real-world problem efficiently using code. This project showcases my ability to:
- Work with and process data from multiple CSV files.
- Filter, clean, and organize data using Python and pandas.
- Handle potential data inconsistencies, such as missing information or incorrect entries.
- Automate a manual task to improve accuracy and save time.

Although the dataset used is specific to my personal project, the code structure and logic can be generalized to handle similar tasks in any context involving multiple files, names, and attributes.

## Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning and Processing**: The code reads multiple CSV files, standardizes donation records, and processes the data for further analysis.
- **Error Handling**: It identifies rows with missing information, such as unfilled chapters, to highlight potential data entry errors.
- **Cross-Referencing**: The script cross-references a list of new member names to identify matching and non-matching donors.
- **Real-World Application**: This project solves a practical problem I encountered, providing both a functional solution and a demonstration of my Python skills.

## Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- pandas


## Notes:
- The dataset used in this project is anonymized with dummy data for privacy reasons.
- This project is not designed to be a general-purpose tool but demonstrates my ability to create custom data analysis solutions for real-world problems.

## About Me
I'm passionate about applying my coding skills to solve real-world problems. This project is just one example of how Iâ€™ve used programming in my personal life to automate tedious tasks and ensure accuracy in data management.
